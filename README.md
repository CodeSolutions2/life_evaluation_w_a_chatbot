# life_evaluation_w_a_chatbot

The purpose of this webapp is to use the [Text-2-chatbot Journal](https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/text_2_chatbot_journal) model to self-evaluate one's progress in life. The goal of the [Audio-2-text Journal](https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/audio_2_text_journal) and [Text-2-chatbot Journal](https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/text_2_chatbot_journal) is to amass speaking and writing data in a journal/file, about important ideas and events in one's life. [Text-2-chatbot Journal](https://github.com/CodeSolutions2/text_2_chatbot_journal) "trains" a chatbot on the journal/file such that one can ask an objective chatbot about how to improve, be happy, and succeed at life. 

This webapp is a methodical way to objectivly understand one's own progress through life, such that one can be more active and choose the life they want. Life evaluation with a chatbot will output a report on two main concepts:
- Evaluate one's current progress with respect to short-term and long-term life goals
- Evaluate one's current knowledge with general/best-level knowledge on a topic/career
